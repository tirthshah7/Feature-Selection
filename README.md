# Feature-Selection
Using Industrial Defined Datasets, We have predicted the accuracy of our model.  
We have used 3 Different methods,  
1) Infinite Feature Selection  
2) Infinite Latent Feature Selection
3) Eigenvector Centrality Feature Selection  

As our Classifiers we have used:  
1) K Nearest Neighbours
2) Random Forests 
3) Multi Layer Perceptron   
  
We have used MATLAB library of FS for generating Ranks and giving that ranks as an input for the classifiers.  

**As a result,**    
We are getting highest accuracy for Random Forest Classifier.
and the lowest for Multi Layer Perceptron.
