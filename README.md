# Feature-Selection
Using Industrial Defined Datasets, We have predicted the accuracy of our model.  
We have used 3 Different methods,  
1) Infinite Feature Selection  
2) Infinite Latent Feature Selection
3) Eigenvector Centrality Feature Selection  

As our Classifiers we have used:  
1) K Nearest Neighbours
2) Random Forests 
3) Multi Layer Perceptron   
  
We have used MATLAB library of FS (by Giorgio version 7.0.2020.3) for generating Ranks   
We gave that ranks as an input for the classifiers and got our model accuracy.  

**As a result,**    
We are getting highest accuracy for Random Forest Classifier.
and the lowest for Multi Layer Perceptron.
